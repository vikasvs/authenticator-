# Proverify (github project title out of date)
Proverify is a platform where recruiters/hiring managers and prospective employees can connect to reduce asymmetric information in the hiring process. If you had an offer you did not take, or an offer that was rescinded due to COVID or other externalities, you can get your offer letter verified by your hiring manager/recruiter who issued the offer letter. Then you will be able to share that link in your recruiting cycles, making you a better candidate to prospective employers. Recruiters and prospective employees can join the platform with a simple sign in, and recruiters can offer unlimited reccomendations/validations to help out prospective employees
